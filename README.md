# Dark Mode Task Manager

A straightforward and adaptable task management application featuring a dark mode interface. Built using fundamental web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—this application stores tasks locally within the browser, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Key Features

*   **Effortless Task Addition:** Quickly add new items to your personal to-do list.
*   **Status Management:** Easily toggle tasks between complete and incomplete states. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strike-through.
*   **Task Removal:** Remove any task from your list with a simple action.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Leverages the browser's local storage capabilities, guaranteeing that your tasks are saved and available each time you return.
*   **Eye-Friendly Dark Mode:** Provides a comfortable viewing experience with a pre-enabled dark color scheme.
*   **Adaptive Layout:** Designed to work effectively across a range of device screen sizes.

## Core Technologies

*   **HTML:** Used to construct the application's layout and content elements.
*   **CSS:** Employed for styling the application, managing the layout, and implementing the dark mode theme.
*   **JavaScript:** Handles user interactions, manages the task lifecycle, and interfaces with local storage.
